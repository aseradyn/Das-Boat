Da's Boat
========

Simple management tool for boats. Track equipment, maintenance tasks, warranty, inspections, certifications, inventory, and more.

Development outline
===================

This is going to take some work, but I'd like to have a working project early on, and then add in features. As such, here's an outline of how I expect to approach the project.

PHASE I - Getting some basics built
-----------------------------------

+ Basic scheduling (recurring tasks and one-off tasks, with due dates)
+ Maintenance log for recording completed tasks
+ Simple equipment list
+ Dashboard with a list of upcoming tasks, upcoming warranty expiration
+ Backup/restore data

PHASE II - Focus on expanding task templates
--------------------------------------------

+ Link documents to task templates and equipment
+ Add lists of required tools and materials to task templates and tasks
+ Simple tool and material lists
+ Simple vendor/supplier list
+ Assign vendors to materials (for purchasing) and tasks/task templates (for contract work)
+ Figure out how to do software updates and data conversions

PHASE III - Adding simple inventory
-----------------------------------

+ Storage location lists
+ Assign tools and materials to locations
+ Assign quantities to tools and materials
+ Assign costs to materials
+ A view to query your inventory

PHASE IV and beyond - Etc
-------------------------

+ Add alert thresholds to materials (for making shopping lists of things you're running low on)
+ Generate printed reports - shopping lists, work history
+ Other requests for changes/improvements

Other "Enhancements" that have been recommended and discarded :oP AKA PHASE VI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Media player that loops "I'm on a Boat" (by The Lonely Island) indefinitely.
